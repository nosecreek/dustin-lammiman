Hi, my name is Dustin and I'm a full-stack web developer.

I also like [hiking](/hikes), [building things](/teardrop), and making [ice cream](/icecream).

Here are a few projects I've been working on lately:

### Grocery Tracker

_Grocery Tracker_ is a tool for saving money on your next trip to the grocery store. It keeps a price history of groceries from some of the major Canadian grocery chains. Think [camelcamelcamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/), but for groceries.

If you'd like to test it out without creating an account, feel free to use this demo login:

- Website: https://grocerytracker.ca/
- Technologies: React, NodeJS, MongoDB

### Buckets Viewer

[_Buckets_](https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/) is a fantastic envelope based budgeting software created by One Part Rain. _Buckets Viewer_ is a web app for viewing these budget files online. It works by opening the budget file (which is actually a SQLite file) from Google Drive.

### Nose Creek Web Design

_Nose Creek Web Design_ is a web design company I founded in 2009 to design, create, and host websites for local small businesses. This includes designing custom WordPress themes and plugins, including a complete RV Rental booking system. Since 2013 I've stepped back from the business a bit, but I continue to maintain and update websites for several existing clients.
