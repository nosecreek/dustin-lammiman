Hi, my name is Dustin and I'm a full-stack web developer in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

I enjoy [hiking](/hikes), [building things](/teardrop), and [making ice cream](/icecream).

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/nosecreek) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustin-lammiman/).

Here are a few projects I've been working on lately:

#### Grocery Tracker

_Grocery Tracker_ is a tool for saving money on your next trip to the grocery store. It keeps a price history for groceries from some of the major Canadian grocery chains. Think [camelcamelcamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/), but for groceries.

If you'd like to test it out without creating an account, feel free to use this demo login:

- Website: https://grocerytracker.ca/
- Technologies: React, NodeJS, MongoDB

#### Buckets Viewer

[_Buckets_](https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com/) is a fantastic envelope based budgeting software created by One Part Rain. _Buckets Viewer_ is a web app for viewing these budget files online. It works by opening the budget file (which is actually a SQLite file) from Google Drive.

A demo budget file is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/nosecreek/buckets-viewer/blob/b5900b688e19f8726f90c71fce17340b846fa7d8/Sample.buckets)

- GitHub: https://github.com/nosecreek/buckets-viewer
- Technologies: React, SQLite, OAuth

#### Nose Creek Web Design

_Nose Creek Web Design_ is a web design company I founded in 2009 to design, create, and host websites for local small businesses. This has included designing custom WordPress themes and plugins, including a complete RV Rental booking system. Since 2013 I've stepped back from the business a bit, but I continue to maintain and update websites for several existing clients.
