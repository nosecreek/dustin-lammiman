We painted about six layers of paint to get to this stage. The first four layers were mostly "oops" paint (mistints, returns, etc.) that we got for cheap at hardware/paint stores. The final two layers were in our desired color. Used painter's tape to get the zigzag pattern on the side. If you look close the lines aren't very clean, so we may have to touch them up in the future.
