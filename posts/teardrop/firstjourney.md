All hooked up to the tow vehicle and ready for it's first camping trip! There are still a few things to finish, but it's road worthy and the camping season is almost over. We weren't sure how heavy it was going to be, but we took it out to the truck scales and it came up at just over 1,200lbs. Which means we can tow it with our existing vehicle! (It has a tow limit of 2,000lbs, and we weren't sure how close to that we were going to be)

Oh, and did I mention we gave it a name? Introducing _The Marmot_!
