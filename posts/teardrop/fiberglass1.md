The method we're using to weatherproof the outside of our trailer is called _poor man's fiberglass_. Essentially we glue large canvas to the trailer and then cover it with many (about six) layers of outdoor paint. Here we are attaching one of the canvas pieces. Before attaching we used an iron to minimize any wrinkles so we end up with a smooth finish.
