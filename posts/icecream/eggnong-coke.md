## Eggnog Ice Cream

### Ingredients

- 1/2 Cup Granulated Sugar
- 2 Tbsp Skim Milk Powder
- 1/4 Tsp Xanthan Gum
- 1 Tsp Ground Nutmeg
- 1 Tbsp Imitation Rum Extract
- 1 1/3 Cups Milk (I used 2%)
- 2 Tbsp Light Corn Syrup
- 1 1/3 Cup Whipping Cream
- 3 Large Egg Yolks

### Instructions

1. In a bowl whisk together sugar, milk powder, nutmeg, and xanthan gum.
2. In a pot add milk, whipping cream, and corn syrup.
3. Whisk dry ingredients into the pot of liquid ingredients. Be sure to mix well.
4. Heat ingredients on medium/high heat, stirring well, until it comes to a boil. Remove from heat.
5. Temper the yolks by placing them in a bowl and slowly adding ~1/2 cup of the hot mixture while whisking well. Pour the yolks back into the main pot while continuing to whisk well.
6. Heat the mixture until it begins to thicken or it reaches a temperature of 180 F.
7. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool for before placing in an air-tight container.
8. Refridgerate for 12+ hours. Then churn according to your ice cream maker's instructions.
9. Split the ice cream into two containers, each ~1L in size. You now have Eggnog ice cream. To make it eggnog and cola ice cream, make cola ice cream (below) and layer it on top!

## Cola Ice Cream

_Note - this one didn't really turn out like I hoped. Not a lot of Cola flavour. I'd like to try finding a Cola syrup for my next attempt._

- 1/3 Cup Skim Milk Powder
- 1/4 Tsp Xanthan Gum

### Instructions

1. Place Cola in a medium pot and boil for ~30-45 minutes, until you have about 1 1/2 Cups of liquid remaining.
1. Meanwhile, in a large bowl whisk together the milk powder and xanthan gum.
1. Add cream and dry ingredients to the reduced cola, whisking well as you add them.
1. Bring the mixture to a simmer, long enough to allow the sugars to completely dissolve into the mixture.

1. Churn according to your ice cream maker's instructions.
1. Split the ice cream into two containers, each ~1L in size. You now have Cola ice cream. To make it eggnog and cola ice cream, layer on top of your eggnog ice cream!
