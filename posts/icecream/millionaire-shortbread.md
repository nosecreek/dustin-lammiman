## Millionaire's Shortbread Ice Cream

### Ingredients
- 1/2 Cup Granulated Sugar
- 2 Tbsp Skim Milk Powder
- 1/4 Tsp Xanthan Gum
- 3 Tbsp Cocoa Powder
- 1 1/3 Cups Milk (I used 2%)
- 3 Tbsp Water
- 2 Tbsp Light Corn Syrup
- 1 1/3 Cup Whipping Cream
- Shortbread Cookies

### Instructions
1. In a bowl whisk together sugar, milk powder, cocoa powder, and xanthan gum.
2. In a pot add milk and corn syrup.
3. Whisk dry ingredients into the pot of liquid ingredients. Be sure to mix well.
4. Heat ingredients for ~5 minutes on medium heat, stirring well, until sugar is disolved.
5. Remove from heat and add remaining cream and allow mixture to cool for a few minutes.
6. Refridgerate for 12+ hours. Then churn according to your ice cream maker's instructions.
7. When ice cream is almost finished churning, cut shortbread cookies into small pieces and add to the ice cream dasher.
8. Once it is well mixed, move your ice cream into an airtight container. Layer half the ice cream, then caramel sauce, then the rest of the ice cream.
9. Freeze the ice cream for 4+ hours before serving.


## Caramel Sauce

### Ingredients
- 3/8 Cup Salted Butter (start with 1/2 cup of butter, and use 3/4 of that)
- 3/4 Cup Brown Sugar (packed)
- 1 Tbsp Water
- Pinch of Salt
- 1/4 Cup Evaporated Milk (I know this is a small amount from a large can - every Christmas I make a batch of [*fantasy fudge*](https://www.myfoodandfamily.com/recipe/051833/fantasy-fudge) and so I'm always looking for recipes that will use the excess evaporate milk. If you don't already have an open can, there are plenty of great caramel recipes that use heavy cream that should work fine instead.)
- 1 Tsp Vanilla Extract

### Instructions
1. Melt butter, sugar, water, and salt together in small pan.
2. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a high simmer for about 5 minutes.
3. Remove from heat and add evaporated milk and vanilla.
4. Mix well, then move to an airtight container and allow to cool completely in the refridgerator before adding to your ice cream.
