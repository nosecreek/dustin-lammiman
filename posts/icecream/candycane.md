## Candy Cane Ice Cream

### Ingredients

- 1/2 Cup Granulated Sugar
- 2 Tbsp Skim Milk Powder
- 1/4 Tsp Xanthan Gum
- 1 1/3 Cups Milk (I used 2%)
- 2 Tbsp Light Corn Syrup
- 1 1/3 Cup Whipping Cream
- 1/2 Tsp Vanilla Extract
- 1/4 Tsp Mint Extract
- 2 Ounces Dark (70%) Chocolate
- 1 Tsp Vegetable Oil
- 3 Regular Size Candy Canes

### Instructions

1. Use a food processor to break the candy canes into small pieces.
2. In a bowl whisk together sugar, milk powder, and xanthan gum.
3. In a pot add milk and corn syrup.
4. Whisk dry ingredients into the pot of liquid ingredients. Be sure to mix well.
5. Heat ingredients for ~5 minutes on medium heat, stirring well, until sugar is disolved.
6. Remove from heat and add remaining cream and allow mixture to cool for a few minutes.
7. Refridgerate for 12+ hours. Then churn according to your ice cream maker's instructions.
8. While ice cream is churning, place a heatproof bowl above a pot that contains about 1 inch of water. The bowl should rest on the pot, but not touch the water.
9. Combine chocolate and vegetable oil in the bowl. Turn the heat to low and stir occasionally until the chocolate is melted. Remove from heat, but leave the bowl on top of the pot until your ice cream is almost ready.
10. When your ice cream is almost ready, slowly drizzle the chocolate into the ice cream. Pour in a thin, steady stream. This will allow the chocolate to harden as it touches the ice cream, creating tasty chocolate speckles.
11. Add candy cane pieces to the ice cream. Once it is well mixed, move your ice cream into an airtight container. Layer half the ice cream, then chocolate sauce, then the rest of the ice cream.
12. Freeze the ice cream for 4+ hours before serving.

## Chocolate Sauce

_Chocolate sauce is optional. It's delicious without it too!_

### Ingredients

- 1/4 Cup Cocoa Powder
- 1/4 Cup Sugar
- 1/4 Cup Water
- Pinch of Salt
- 1/2 Tsp Vanilla

### Instructions

1. Whisk together cocoa and sugar in a saucepan.
2. Add water and salt and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, continuing to whisk the mixture.
3. Reduce to a simmer and continue to whisk for about 30 seconds.
4. Remove from heat and add vanilla.
5. Store in the refridgerator in a sealed container.
