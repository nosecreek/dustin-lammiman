Since today is Remembrance Day, I thought I would post a few pictures of my trip to Belgium where I visited &#8220;Flanders Fields&#8221;. Ypress, Belgium was the site of the famous battle of Passchendaele.

One of the many World War I cemeteries in the area. Many of these graves are of Canadian soldiers.

The tomb of an unknown Canadian soldier.

A sobering reminder of how terrible the war was. This plaque was part of a Canadian war memorial about 10 minutes away from the graveyard pictured above.

This famous poem was written by John McCrae near Ypres, Belgium.
