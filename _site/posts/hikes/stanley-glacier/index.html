<p>Some hikes are all about the beautiful view at the destination, but with Stanley Glacier you enjoy beautiful and changing scenery for the duration of the hike. You will climb towards the toe of Stanley Glacier as you travel alongside a waterfall and the burned but beautiful remnants of a forest fire.</p>
