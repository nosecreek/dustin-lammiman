<p>Johnston canyon is extermely popular. This isn't without reason as the canyon is beautiful. But if you keep hiking beyond the upper falls you will eventually reach the Ink Pots which are the real jewel of this hike. The portion of the trail after the upper falls is the most intense, with significantly more elevation gain. But you will also be glad to be away from the crowds for a while. After a long, steady incline you'll eventually head back down hill and reach the Ink Pots, which are spring fed pools of water with brilliant color in the midst of a mountain meadow. Be sure to heed the signs and don't disturb the pools. Pack a lunch and take some time to picnic while you enjoy the natural beauty of your destination.</p>
